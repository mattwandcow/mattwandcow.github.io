        <h2>Places to See</h2>
        <p>Cozumel is filled with many amazing places to go and sights to see. Here are a few we've picked out to spotlight, but check back often for more!</p>
        <section>
            <h3>Punta Sur Park</h3>
            <img class="tour-img" src="images/punta-sur.jpg" alt="The Beaches of Punta Sur">
            <p>
The southern end of Cozumel is reserved as an ecological park. Covering the reefs off shore, the low forests inland, and all of 
the beautiful beaches and lagoons inbetween, there is no better place to get in tough with nature. Go snorkeling at the Devil's
Throat and the nearby reefs, observe the local wildlife which may include hatching sea turtles, and take a ride on a boat around
the Colombia Lagoon with a professional guide.

            <img class="tour-img" src="images/jade-cavern.jpg" alt="The Mysterious Jade Caverns">
            <p>
                When you come to Cozumel, don't live life the way you do back home. Why swim in a concrete pool, when you can swim in an all-natural cavern,
                with a ceiling of stone and water as green as jade. Refreshingly cool, both in temperature and figuratively!  Dive off a cliff and swim around
                rock that has been there for centuries.
